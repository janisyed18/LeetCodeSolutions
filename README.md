## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular platform for practicing coding problems, especially those related to algorithms and data structures. It provides a wide range of challenges that cover various difficulty levels, allowing you to hone your programming skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem categories and problem IDs. Each problem category contains subdirectories named after the problem IDs. Inside each problem directory, you will find:

- A solution file (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`, etc.) containing the code solution for the problem.
- A README file (e.g., `README.md`) explaining the problem statement, approach, and any important points to consider.

## How to Use

1. Browse through the relevant problem category directories to find the problem you're interested in.
2. Inside each problem directory, you'll find the solution code in the specified programming language.
3. Read the accompanying README file to understand the problem statement, the approach used to solve it, and any other relevant information.

Please note that these solutions are provided for educational purposes and as references. Understanding the logic and thought process behind each solution is more important than directly copying the code.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your changes.
3. Add your solution in the appropriate category and problem ID directory.
4. Include a well-written README file explaining the problem and your approach.
5. Create a pull request describing your changes for review.
